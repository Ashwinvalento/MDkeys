Machine Dependent Key Authentication library

Ever faced issues with Licencing an application ? 

Application authentication is an Open Source Java library which aims to provide a different approach to counter unlawful usage of 
software. The industry has been affected immensely by the widespread use of software using 
counterfeit keys.

Usually the process of validating a copy of a software is done by using a key or a 
similar token. Once the process of generating these keys is cracked, people can attack the 
pattern to obtain more keys which can be used to access the software.
Application Authentication aims to overcome this problem by binding the license key to the 
hardware of a system. The hardware components of a system such as motherboard, network 
Interface card and hard disk are the backbone to this approach. Here the hardware ID's of the 
system play a very important role in ensuring that one copy of the software can be run only 
on one computer. We obtain the component ID of the above mentioned hardware and utilize 
them to generate tokens to authenticate the software. This ensures that one particular copy of 
a software can be run only on one particular system.
